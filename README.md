# gp_algos
Repository containing some machine learning algorithms exploiting Gaussian Processes method. 
Those algorithms comprise:
- real-valued function prediction (regression) based on GP
- binary classification based on GP with "Expectation propagation" approximation algorithm 
- fitting kernel parameters for regression and classification problems by maximizing the MLE value
- real-valued function optimisation based on GP
- Kalman and Unscented Kalman filter(UKF) algorithms for inference in State Space models
- GP-UKF algorithm, the modification of standard UKF exploiting GP method
